# LearnAndFun

## Description

LearnAndFun is a web application where teachers can upload their lessons and students are able to learn from them. Lessons are structured in several subjects and students can solve the tests that teachers have previously designed. All the scores of a given lesson belong to a common ranking, so students can check their particular progress.
The video demo below shows its basic funcionality.

The project uses **MVC** as design pattern and its arquitecture is **API Rest** based. NodeJS and MongoDB configure the backend side, while Bootstrap is the main framework used on frontend side. So, the programming languages involved here are Javascript, CSS and HTML. 

# Build setup

- NodeJS and MongoDB must be already installed in your machine.
```
# run MongoDB
mongod

# install dependencies
npm install

# start server 
node app
```

- Open your browser and test the application on *localhost:9001*
